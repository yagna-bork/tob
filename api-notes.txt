Ordinance Survey: Coordinates -> Address, Classification code
	fields: ADDRESS, X_COORDINATE, Y_COORDINATE, CLASSIFICATION_CODE, CLASSIFICATION_CODE_DESCRIPTION
Business rates (in theory): Address -> Further commercial classification, Floorspace info
	Primary description codes are very detailed about the type of business
Planit: Coordinates -> Planning history

Aggregating touch points into locus:
	Headline type: Commercial, Mixed-use, Residential
	Individual buildings within locus have (via address)
		additional business rates & planning permission streams integrated
	Planning only locus have headline type: Development
	Planning only points are called Sites

	Address approach:
		Building = BUILDING_NUMBER, subunits = ORGANISATION_NAME
		Building = BUILDING_NAME, BUILDING_NUMBER, subunits = SUB_BUILDING_NAME
		Building = Common name within BUILDING_NAME, subunit = Individual flat no within BUILDING_NAME

Business rates database:
List entries (P+S description code, p+s description text, full identifier, firm name, rateable value)
Summary valuations (Total area, total units, total value, total rateable value)

Further:
Setup endpoint and serve json data as is
Combine planning apps into Building data as much as possible
	OS titles stuff

Look at domestics rates database
	That's private information. Not possible to access the database

Restructing make_requests:
Building structs in one file with code to build them (OS Radius API call) & combine them
Database code in a seperate class
PlanningApplication structs and planit calls in seperate file
http-server main file outside of include folder w/ 2 endpoints: for buildings and for planning applications
	while they're still seperate for the moment

cmake -- finally:
pass
